# Extract_Stratigraphic_Slices

Using data from Rohit Arora (Link at the bottom)

This is my take in the data given about extracting channels from stratigraphic slices, the base code is using Z Score Transformation and MLPClassifier

Not to be bested, I tried to transform the preprocessing method, using feature transform in various ways in preprocessing and finding the best hyperparameter
for MLPClassifier using GridSearchCV (Though with different random_seed #42forlife).

## Result
I have been bested. You win this round.
